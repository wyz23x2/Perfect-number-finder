# Perfect-number-finder
##### These Python projects calculate perfect numbers using these characteristics of perfect numbers:
##### 1.Perfect numbers are all triangular numbers. 6==1+2+3; 28==1+2+3+4+5+6+7; 496==1+2+3+4+……30+31; 8128==1+2+3……+126+127.
##### 2.Perfect numbers all end in 6 or 28.
##### 3.Perfect numbers % 3==1, % 9==1, has 1 in % 27(except 6).
## 2.0 Version
##### 2.0 version calculates perfect numbers based on the characteristics above. Times: (seconds)
##### 6: <0.1;
##### 28: <0.1;
##### 496: <0.2;
##### 8128: <0.3;
##### 33550336: 540 ~ 590.
##### Unfortunately, 2.0 has not calculated to 8589869056 in 44 hours.
## 2.0t Version
##### This is a branch from 2.0, usually used for testing. It shows the time calculated after the perfect number.
